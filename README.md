# Discord-bot
for my comrade at VVS - first generation Minh Nguyen - second generation Paris

For this bot to work, you will need to download ffmpeg into the same path and directory as your discord bot code as you can see from the picture below

Youtube dl once downloaded, you will only need to import it in your code. 

The song.mp3 file is neccesary for the music to be stored. If it disappear somehow, create a new file with the same name and at the same location as the former song.mp3 file

after that, you know what to do, activate the bot.py file and the bot will be up and running
